## Research

Two major different types of inkjet

a) thermal - benefit to trying many different materials as drivers/cartridges are disposable
b) piezo - better for diversity of materials as no change of phase is needed.

They both have their pros and cons, both systems generally struggle with higher viscosities.

Annoyingly they all have their own driver styles.

Past projects
- Epson
-- issue: proprietary drivers trigger methods
-- issue: can't do viscous reagents
- [Xaar 128](https://github.com/gkyle/xaar128?tab=readme-ov-file)
-- issue: exposed traces, no aqueous options
